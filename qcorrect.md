Question 5: An overflow error would occur because with only 3 bits to represent the integer, the decimal value could only go up to 7. Trying to represent 5+3 would be 8 and would not work, causing an overflow error.

Question 22: The running speed of the game could be improved by using a proccess to find approximate solutions. Although making the game multiplayer would make the game run faster, that would defeat the purpose of the game.

Question 43: The internet iteslf is not designed to incorporate encryption protocols and is not secure by itself. The only true statement is that internet is designed to scale to increasing user numbers.

# Week 3 Study Plan

- Continue to review Collegeboard videos
- Continue to review Khan Academy videos
- Go over missed quiz questions and make sure I understand why I got them wrong and what the correct answer is.

### Reflection
This week I got 47/50 on the quiz. Although I went down in score a little from last week, I still did pretty well. However now that I know that Collegeboard has gotten stricter with the CSP grading, I will continue to study hard.

Question 43: People with premium accounts are less likely to have targeted ads show up on their feed because their paid account allows them to not see advertisements.

Question 50: The variable second, while initially assigned the value 200, is later assigned the value of temp, which is 100. The variable first is initially assigned the value 100, and then later assigned the value of second, which at that point in the code segment is also 100.

Question 9 : The new system would not be able to provide a human representative for any call because outside of business hours, no one could respond. They couldn't select the incorrect department because they literally can not. 

Question 23 : Cookies stored on a web browser is more likely a compromise to personal privacy then your ip because your ip doesn't contain any extra private information than your pc address.

Question 22 : IPV 6 allows more devices to be connected to the internet, not faster packet routing 

Question 35 : Adding the two positive integers might result in an overflow error because the sum that is created is greater than what can be displayed, not approximation errors. 

Question 42 : Cloud computing enhances collaboration and introduces new data security concerns. It does not eliminate the need for redundancy at all.

Question 50 : It would be options 1, 2, and 3 because the average increase in total points per student as a result of the score replacement policy can also be determined by calculating the differences between each student score before and after the replacement policy was applied.

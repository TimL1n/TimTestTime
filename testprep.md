## Test Prep

## 5.4 Crowdsourcing
* Kaggle
  * Courses in visualizations, TensorFlow, AI, machine learning
  * Competitions
  * Notebooks
* Distributed Computing
  * Donate spare computing power to help calculations
* Spotify
  * Collaborative playlists
  * Algorithm
  * Metadata write in
* Crowdfunding
  * Kickstarter
  * IndieGoGo
* BlockChain

### Actions:
1. CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
One crowdsourcing idea that could apply is using crowdsourcing to create ideas for a collective website we all work on. Or maybe to figure out a person/group's grade, we could use crowdsourcing to come to a collective agreement on the grade the student should receive.

2. What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
Across Del Norte, crowdsourcing could be used just to find a variety of different data across the school and different groups and people. For example, the surveys we sometimes take in homeroom are an example of crowdsourcing. I think our final project is pretty good with crowdsourcing because we take user data to rate and review different trails.

## 5.3 Computing Bias
* Netflix
  * Explicit Data 
    * Name, address
  * Implicit Data
    * When you watch
    * What you watch
    * Style of show
  * Bias 
    * Exclusives featured ahead of most
* Software can be biased
  * Casual vs Sweaty
  * Youtube Kids
  * Facebook vs Instagram vs Snapchat/Tik Tok
  * WeChat/KakaoTalk

### Actions:
The owner knows it is unintentional and is just joking around with how it won't follow him. This is obvious because they both laugh and smile throughout the video. This likely occured because the facecam software probably uses a facial recognition software that maybe detects faces depending on contrast of skin to facial features like eyes, noes, mouth, eyebrows maybe. Or the software recognizes faces through a database of pictures with and without faces that puts together what is similar of the faced pictures. So with more of a contrast from a white face to darker features than a darker face to more similar colored features, the white face will be recognized easier. Or the software recognizes faces through a database of pictures with and without faces that puts together what is similar of the faced pictures and the pictures are primarily lighter toned people. It technically is harmful because it makes it so people of darker skin tone can't use the feature. Luckily however, the feature doesn't seem that useful and wouldn't be used very much, making it less harmful than it would be if many people utilized it. This should for sure be corrected and can be by making the databsase include pictures of darker toned people(if they used one).

## 5.2 Digital Divide
* Based on socioeconomic and geographic demographics
* In some countries
  * Computers are not common in rural areas
  * Only small number of websites
  * Internet used to protect government
  * High level of surveillance to protect government

### Actions:
1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?

The digital world has access to so much info at once that you can empower yourself simply by learning from the massive amounts of data on the web. 

2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.

A way to help empower others is to teach. Take the info you’ve learned online and through the web to help others learn, especially if they don’t have access to those same resources you have. Even at Del Norte we can help empower others through teaching them how to better utilize and use their technology to its fullest capabilities.

3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?

I think red tape does block digital empowerment often. Here at Del Norte we are pretty well off, the only red tape blocking us is the internet which sometimes blocks sites we could use for learning more about coding. For the most part it isn’t that bad though. However in other places, there are likely lots of things preventing digital empowerment. All policies have to go through bureaucracy and so it may take time before other people are able to digitally empower themselves due to restrictions and blocks placed in front of them.

### Actions
1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing

Some Benefits of computing are that there is increased efficiency in production of everyday goods which decreases costs, Decreased need for paper and paper products which saves trees, Increased productivity for general daily tasks ie; typing is faster than writing notes physically which increases productivity. Some harmful effects of computing include the Creation of gambling/gacha games which makes it very easy for people to fall victim to gambling addiction, Easy to access illegal content which may facilitate crimes, requires lots of energy and manufacturing which may increase the amount of pollution.

2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?

Dopamine issues within our generations are definitely a real problem. With easy access to many things that can give you instant gratification, it can create too much constant dopamine. This would numb you to dopamine and require more to feel the same joys and highs you previously would, very similar to reactions when taking drugs. It creates a sort of addiction which can be linked back to computers and access to pretty much anything whenever you want
